# nginx-certbot-docker
Docker image for NGINX configured with SSL through Let's Encrypt CA

You gonna wanna do some adjustments to the nginx config file and to the getcert.sh file to refrect your domain name.

You do want to keep your own copy of this privatly. What I do on my productive server is copy this repository (not fork, but copy it) and double maintain a private repository with the configuration I'm using.
